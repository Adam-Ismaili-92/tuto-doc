Deploy your documentation
=========================

To conclude this tutorial, now that our documentation is ready
to be shared publicly, we will **deploy** our documentation
on the internet.

To do this, we will try two tools: `GitHub Pages <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart>`_ and
`Read the Docs <https://about.readthedocs.com/>`_, starting with the simplest one, GitHub Pages.
